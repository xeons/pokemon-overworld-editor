Pokémon Overworld Sprite Editor
===============================
This is a Pokémon Overworld Sprite Editor for the GameBoy Advance series of games written in Visual Basic 6.

Sprite Navigation
-----------------
This is where you can pick the index of the sprite
to edit, there are over 200 sprites on all the games.

Right now there is no way of determining how many
frames each sprite has, so if you go over how many
frames are actually in a sprite, it will start reading
from the sprite # after it.
